             As guys you know, we’ve been exploring options to raise funds to make it worthwhile for us to keep this website running next season. 
             
             If you guys have enjoyed using Soccer Streams so far, please consider using one of the donation buttons below to help support the website. Any amount you pledge towards the website will be wholeheartedly appreciated by everyone at Soccer Streams. 
             
             Donations will allow us to continue running the website, upgrade servers to accommodate more users, add new features and more mods to help out. We are always looking to improve your experience here and we want to be able to continue doing that.
             
             We will continue accepting donations next season, and these Soccer Streams Supporters will receive some really cool perks and added services in return for their generosity. Since we haven’t been able to implement this system yet, we will award these same perks to everyone that donates as per our final criteria, so please ensure that you make a note of your transaction ID and preferably a screenshot of the final payment processed page.
             
             If for some reason you haven’t enjoyed using Soccer Streams enough to make you want to donate, please do get in touch with us via the contact form and tell us what we can do to improve our service and help change your mind.
             
             Lastly, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to everyone that stuck around during the tough times and who continue to help build this community. 
             
             Onward and upwards.

			 Cheers!
